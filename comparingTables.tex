\section{Comparing two Tables}
\subsection{Introduction}

Let $T$ and $T'$ be tables with columns \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}.
$T'$ might be a synthetic generated dataset from the real dataset $T$.
So the content in the columns might differ between the tables.

As before $a \sim_T b$ is true if and only if $a$ in column \texttt{A} and $b$ in column \texttt{B} are in the same row in table $T$.
Now we have additionally $a \sim_{T'} b$ is true if and only if $a$ in column \texttt{A} and $b$ in column \texttt{B} are in the same row in table~$T'$.
We keep $A = \{ a : a \mbox{ is in column \texttt{A} of table } T \}$ and $B = \{ b : b \mbox{ is in column \texttt{B} of table } T \}$ and add $A' = \{ a : a \mbox{ is in column \texttt{A} of table } T' \}$ as $B' = \{ b : b \mbox{ is in column \texttt{B} of table } T' \}$ and $B^* = B \cup B'$.

Let $\tau$ be $T$ or $T'$ and $M$ a set.
Define $F_{\tau, M} : A \to \mathcal{P}(M)$ as $F_{\tau, M}(a) = \{ x \in M : a \sim_\tau x \}$.

Due to the construction of $A$ and $B$ the set $F_{T,B^*}(a) = F_{T,B}(a)$ is never empty for all $a \in A$.
But it might be that $F_{T',B^*}(a)$ is empty for some $a \in A$ as $a$ might not be in column \texttt{A} in table $T'$.


\subsection{Helping Functions}
\subsubsection{$d_1 : A \to [0,1]$}
First we want to have a measure on how good the positive relation got preserved ($a \sim_T b \Rightarrow a \sim_{T'} b$).
Assume $F_{T, M}(a)$ is not empty. 
This could archived by:

\[
  d^*_{T,T',M}(a) = 
    \frac{\left|F_{T, M}(a) \cap F_{T', M}(a)\right|}{|F_{T, M}(a)|}
\]


As $0 \leq \left|F_{T, M}(a) \cap F_{T', M}(a)\right| \leq |F_{T, M}(a)|$ we have $0 \leq d^*_{T, T', M}(a) \leq 1$.
With $d^*_{T, T', M}(a) = 0$ when $F_{T, M}(a)$ and $F_{T', M}(a)$ have no item in common
and $d^*_{T, T', M}(a) = 1$ when $F_{T, M}(a) \subseteq F_{T', M}(a)$.

In case of $F_{T, M}(a)$ is empty there is no item in $F_{T, M}(a)$ to prove the preservation of the positive relation false.
So we set $d^*_{T, T', M}(a) = 1$ in this case.
We get:
\[
  d^*_{T,T',M}(a) = 
  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{\left|F_{T, M}(a) \cap F_{T', M}(a)\right|}{|F_{T, M}(a)|}
    & \mbox{; if } |F_{T, M}(a)| > 0
    \\[1em] 1 & \mbox{; if } |F_{T, M}(a)| = 0
  \end{array}\right.
\]



\subsubsection{$d^{**}_{T,T',M} : A \to [0,1]$}
Lets do the same for the complement so we can measure how good the negative relation got preserved (not $a \sim_T b \Rightarrow$ not $a \sim_{T'} b$).
To archive this we have a look to the complement of the image of $a$.
Assume $F_{T, M}(a) \neq M$
\[
  d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a) = 
    \frac{\left|\left(M \setminus F_{T, M}(a)\right) \cap \left(M \setminus F_{T', M}(a)\right)\right|}{|M \setminus F_{T, M}(a)|}
    = \frac{\left|M \setminus \left(F_{T, M}(a) \cup F_{T', M}(a)\right)\right|}{|M| - |F_{T, M}(a)|}
    = \frac{|M| - \left|F_{T, M}(a) \cup F_{T', M}(a)\right|}{|M| - |F_{T, M}(a)|}
\]

As $F_{T, M}(a) \subseteq F_{T, M}(a) \cup F_{T', M}(a)$ we have $|F_{T, M}(a)| \leq |F_{T, M}(a) \cup F_{T', M}(a)|$.
Keeping in mind that $F_{\tau, M}(a) \subseteq M$ for $\tau \in \{ T, T' \}$
it follows that $|M| - |F_{T, M}(a)| \geq |M| - |F_{T, M}(a) \cup F_{T', M}(a)| \geq 0$.
Therefore $0 \leq d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a) \leq 1$.

We have $d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a) = 0$ when $M \setminus F_{T, M}(a)$ and $M \setminus F_{T', M}(a)$ have no item in common (for example when $F_{T', M}(a) = M$).
Also we have $d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a) = 1$ when all items in the complement of $F_{T, M}(a)$ are in the complement of $F_{T', M}(a)$ too (e.g: $F_{T', M}(a) \subseteq F_{T, M}(a)$).

In case of $F_{T, M}(a) = M$ there is no element in the complement of $F_{T, M}(a)$.
In this case we can set the value of $d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a)$ to $1$.
So we have:

\[
  d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a) =
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{\left|M| - |F_{T, M}(a) \cup F_{T', M}(a)\right|}{|M| - |F_{T, M}(a)|}
    & ; \mbox{if } F_{T, M}(a) \neq M
    \\[1em]
    1
    & ; \mbox{if } F_{T, M}(a) = M
\end{array}\right.
\]


\subsubsection{$d : A \to [0,1]$ and $\hat{d} : A \to [0,1]$}

As $d^*_{T,T',M}(a) = 1$ when $F_{T', M}(a) \subseteq F_{T, M}(a)$ and $d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a) = 1$ when $F_{T', M}(a) \subseteq F_{T, M}(a)$ we can create functions that are $1$ if and only if $F_{T, M}(a) = F_{T', M}(a)$.
We will use this two:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
  d(a) & = d^*_{T,T',M}(a) \cdot d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a)
  \\[1em]
  \hat{d}(a) & = \frac{d^*_{T,T',M}(a) + d^{**}_{T,T',M}(a)}{2}
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Our Table Comparing Function: $\Delta_{T,T'} : A \times B^* \to [0,1]$}

Summing this values for all $a \in A$ and dividing by the size of $A$ we get our measurement \mbox{$\Delta_{T,T'} : A \times B^* \to [0,1]$}
with $\Delta_{T,T'}(A, B^*) = 1$ if and only if $F_{T, B^*}(a) = F_{T', B^*}(a)$ for all $a \in A$.
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{T,T'}(A, B^*) = 
    \frac{1}{|A|} 
    \sum_{a \in A} (d^*_{T,T',B^*}(a) \cdot d^{**}_{T,T',B^*}(a))
\end{equation}

% Alternative definition with the same meaning could be:
% 
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Delta}_{T,T'}(A, B^*) = 
    \frac{1}{2 |A|} 
    \sum_{a \in A} (d^*_{T,T',B^*}(a) + d^{**}_{T,T',B^*}(a))
\end{equation}
 
 



\subsection{Thoughts}
The function $\Delta_{T,T'}(A, B)$ will tend faster to zero than $\hat{\Delta}_{T,T'}(A, B)$
